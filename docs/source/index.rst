Tradesman is a package for building transport models from open data sources. You can easily download network data from OpenStreetMap, import population, and build zones. It is also possible to download information related to female and male population per age bracket, as well as import amenities and building information from OpenStreetMap. An modulo for building synthetic population from the model data is also provided.

This analytics pipeline is organized in sections for ease of use, and some
expertise in transportation planning/modelling/forecasting may be useful when
utilizing some of the more advanced analysis.

It is also noteworthy that this pipeline was designed to handle both whole-of-country
data, but smaller areas, such as states or cities, for example.

Finally, the pipeline has been tightly integrated with a few data sources, and
while that allows for fast deployment for any region on Earth, it also makes it
somewhat complex to incorporate bespoke data sources.
